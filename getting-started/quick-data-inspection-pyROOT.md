### Required python headers

When we write our python script we need to import the ROOT libraries, and any REST library we used to generate or process our files. Some examples of REST available libraries are: `libRestRaw.so`, `libRestDetector.so`, `libRestGeant4`, `libRestTrack`, and/or `libRestAxion`. On top of that we need always to include the main or core library, `libRestFramework.so` that loads the common REST classes.

The following header should be always included in your script adding a line for each library you will need.

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

import ROOT

# We load the REST libraries
ROOT.gSystem.Load("libRestFramework.so")

# We are reading simulation data we will need at least the Geant4 library
ROOT.gSystem.Load("libRestGeant4.so")
```

### Opening a ROOT file generated with REST

Once the required libraries have been loaded, the first main class we need to know in REST is [TRestRun](https://sultan.unizar.es/rest/classTRestRun.html). TRestRun defines few helper methods that centralize the access to the event data, the analysis tree and event data. It can be used to open a ROOT file generated with REST, and access the data in a coherent way.

The following example shows how to create a `TRestRun` instance , named *rn* in this script, print the run metadata information, and get the number of event entries stored inside the file.

```python
# We open a ROOT file generated by REST
rn = ROOT.TRestRun("Run_g4Analysis_5MeV_1um.root" )

# We print the information of the run metadata object
rn.PrintMetadata()

# We get the number of entries
nEntries =  rn.GetEntries()
print ( "The number of entries is : " + str( nEntries ) )
```

### Retrieving the file metadata objects using TRestRun

The following example uses the already existing *rn* instance to retrieve a list of metadata objects found inside the file, prints the list with the metadata name together with its specific metadata class name, and calls the `PrintMetadata` method (present at any metadata class) to print information regarding one of the metadata objects in the list.

```python
# We retrieve the metadata object names registered inside the file
mdNames = rn.GetMetadataStructureNames()

# We iterate over the list and print the name together with the object class name
print("\n")
print ("The following metadata objects are found inside the file")
print ("--------------------------------------------------------")
for md in mdNames:
    print ( md + " is: " + rn.GetMetadata( md ).ClassName() )
print("\n") 

# We print the metadata information from the second element in the list
print ("We print the metadata information of the second element in the list:" )
print ("--------------------------------------------------------------------")
rn.GetMetadata( mdNames[1] ).PrintMetadata() 
```
