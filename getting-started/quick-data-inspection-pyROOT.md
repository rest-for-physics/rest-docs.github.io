### Required python headers

When we write our python script we need to import the ROOT libraries, and any REST library we used to generate or process our files. Some examples of REST available libraries are: `libRestRaw.so`, `libRestDetector.so`, `libRestGeant4`, `libRestTrack`, and/or `libRestAxion`. On top of that we need always to include the main or core library, `libRestFramework.so` that loads the common REST classes.

The following header should be always included in your script adding a line for each library you will need.

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

import ROOT

# We load the REST libraries
ROOT.gSystem.Load("libRestFramework.so")

# We are reading simulation data we will need at least the Geant4 library
ROOT.gSystem.Load("libRestGeant4.so")
```

### Opening a ROOT file generated with REST

Once the required libraries have been loaded, the first main class we need to know in REST is [TRestRun](https://sultan.unizar.es/rest/classTRestRun.html). [TRestRun](https://sultan.unizar.es/rest/classTRestRun.html) defines few helper methods to centralize the access to the event data, the analysis tree and event data. It can be used to open a ROOT file generated with REST, and access the data in a coherent way.

```python

# We open a ROOT file generated by REST
run = ROOT.TRestRun("Run_5MeV_1um.root" )

# We print the information of the run metadata object
run.PrintMetadata()

```
